i, uh, wasn't expecting anyone to _actually read this_. given, y'know, how many subfiles are present, and the fact that you had to click this and all that.

but since you ~are~, i suppose i owe you a joke and a chicago fact

##### joke

where do cats go when they die?
*purr*gatory

(this joke also works in spanish)

##### chicago fact

in the early 1900s, chicago had a really dirty river. so dirty, in fact, that Chicagoans eveywhere were very annoyed with it. eventually, they decided to do something about it, and reversed the flow of the river so that it now flowed away from the lake and not towards it. chicago naturally did what anyone would do: reverse the flow of the river and send the dirty water towards St. Louis instead.

This sent the very polluted water to St. Louis. St. Louis disliked this for some reason, and complained about how "THE RIVER IS SO DIRTY IT IS LITERALLY BLUE." They filed for an injunction, with the case eventually making its way to SCOTUS. 

SCOTUS, ever the shining voice of reason, sided with Chicago and refused to grant the injunction.


##### one last thing

possible this is a bad idea, but if you're reading this, i'd greatly appreciate it if you add to it, at least on your fork
