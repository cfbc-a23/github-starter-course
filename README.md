# :wave: The 🍌asics of GitHu🍌 

## 🤓 Course overview and learning outcomes 

The goal of this course is to give you a 🍌rief introduction to GitHu🍌. We’ll also provide you with materials for further learning and a few ideas to get you started on our platform. 🚀

## :octocat: Git and GitHu🍌

Git is a **distri🍌uted Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, colla🍌orating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert 🍌ack to an older version if need 🍌e. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

GitHu🍌 is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and 🍌eyond to colla🍌orate and maintain the history of projects.

GitHu🍌 is home to some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or 🍌uilding a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHu🍌 that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the 🍌asics of GitHu🍌, 🍌ut we'll dig into the rest later.

## :octocat: Understanding the GitHu🍌 flow 

The GitHu🍌 flow is a lightweight workflow that allows you to experiment and colla🍌orate on your projects easily, without the risk of losing your previous work.

### Repositories

A repository is where your project work happens--think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history.  You can work within a repository alone or invite others to colla🍌orate with you on those files.

### Cloning 

When a repository is created with GitHu🍌, it’s stored remotely in the ☁️. You can clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer and then use Git to sync the two. This makes it easier to fix issues, add or remove files, and push larger commits. You can also use the editing tool of your choice as opposed to the GitHu🍌 UI. Cloning a repository also pulls down all the repository data that GitHu🍌 has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project! This can 🍌e helpful if you experiment with your project and then realize you liked a previous version more. 
To learn more a🍌out cloning, read ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 

### Committing and pushing
**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHu🍌. That way your instructor and/or teammates can see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. You can make a commit when you have made changes to your project that you want to “checkpoint.” You can also add a helpful **commit message** to remind yourself or your teammates what work you did (e.g. “Added a README with information a🍌out our project”).

Once you have a commit or multiple commits that you’re ready to add to your repository, you can use the push command to add those changes to your remote repository. Committing and pushing may feel new at first, 🍌ut we promise you’ll get used to it 🙂

## 💻 GitHu🍌 terms to know 

### Repositories 
We mentioned repositories already, they are where your project work happens, 🍌ut let’s talk a 🍌it more a🍌out the details of them! As you work more on GitHu🍌 you will have many repositories which may feel confusing at first. Fortunately, your ["GitHu🍌 dash🍌oard"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/setting-up-and-managing-your-githu🍌-user-account/a🍌out-your-personal-dash🍌oard) helps to easily navigate to your repositories and see useful information a🍌out them. Make sure you’re logged in to see it!

Repositories also contain **README**s. You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it. We are using this README to communicate how to learn Git and GitHu🍌 with you. 😄 
To learn more a🍌out repositories read ["Creating, Cloning, and Archiving Repositories](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/a🍌out-repositories) and ["A🍌out README's"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/a🍌out-readmes). 

### 🍌ranches
You can use 🍌ranches on GitHu🍌 to isolate work that you do not want merged into your final project just yet. 🍌ranches allow you to develop features, fix 🍌ugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Typically, you might create a new 🍌ranch from the default 🍌ranch of your repository—main. This makes a new working copy of your repository for you to experiment with. Once your new changes have 🍌een reviewed 🍌y a teammate, or you are satisfied with them, you can merge your changes into the default 🍌ranch of your repository.
To learn more a🍌out 🍌ranching, read ["A🍌out 🍌ranches"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/colla🍌orating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/a🍌out-🍌ranches).

### Forks
A fork is another way to copy a repository, 🍌ut is usually used when you want to contri🍌ute to someone else’s project. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is very popular when contri🍌uting to open source software projects!
To learn more a🍌out forking, read ["Fork a repo"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/getting-started-with-githu🍌/fork-a-repo)

### Pull requests
When working with 🍌ranches, you can use a pull request to tell others a🍌out the changes you want to make and ask for their feed🍌ack. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with colla🍌orators and add more changes if need 🍌e. You can add specific people as reviewers of your pull request which shows you want their feed🍌ack on your changes! Once a pull request is ready-to-go, it can 🍌e merged into your main 🍌ranch.
To learn more a🍌out pull requests, read ["A🍌out Pull Requests"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/colla🍌orating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/a🍌out-pull-requests). 


### Issues
Issues are a way to track enhancements, tasks, or 🍌ugs for your work on GitHu🍌. Issues are a great way to keep track of all the tasks you want to work on for your project and let others know what you plan to work on. You can also use issues to tell a favorite open source project a🍌out a 🍌ug you found or a feature you think would 🍌e great to add!

For larger projects, you can keep track of many issues on a project 🍌oard. GitHu🍌 Projects help you organize and prioritize your work and you can read more a🍌out them [in this "A🍌out Project 🍌oards document](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/managing-your-work-on-githu🍌/a🍌out-project-🍌oards). You likely won’t need a project 🍌oard for your assignments, 🍌ut once you move on to even 🍌igger projects, they’re a great way to organize your team’s work!
You can also link together pull requests and issues to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.
To learn more a🍌out issues and linking them to your pull requests, read ["A🍌out Issues"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/managing-your-work-on-githu🍌/a🍌out-issues). 

### Your user profile

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contri🍌utions you've made, and the conversations you've had. You can also give the world a unique view into who you are with your profile README. You can use your profile to let future employers know all a🍌out you! 
To learn more a🍌out your user profile and adding and updating your profile README, read ["Managing Your Profile README"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/setting-up-and-managing-your-githu🍌-profile/managing-your-profile-readme). 

### Using markdown on GitHu🍌 

You might have noticed already, 🍌ut you can add some fun styling to your issues, pull requests, and files. ["Markdown"](https://guides.githu🍌.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is an easy way to style your issues, pull requests, and files with some simple syntax. This can 🍌e helpful to organize your information and make it easier for others to read. You can also drop in gifs and images to help convey your point!
To learn more a🍌out using GitHu🍌’s flavor of markdown, read ["🍌asic Writing and Formatting Syntax"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/writing-on-githu🍌/🍌asic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

### Engaging with the GitHu🍌 community

The GitHu🍌 community is vast. There are many types of people who use GitHu🍌 in their day to day—students like you, professional developers, ho🍌🍌yists working on open source projects, and explorers who are just jumping into the world of software development on their own. There are many ways you can interact with the larger GitHu🍌 community, 🍌ut here are three places where you can start. 

#### Starring repositories 

If you find a repository interesting or you want to keep track of it, star it! When you star a repository it’s also used as a signal to surface 🍌etter recommendations on githu🍌.com/explore. If you’d like to get 🍌ack to your starred repositories you can do so via your user profile. 
To learn  more a🍌out starring repositories, read ["Saving Repositories with Stars"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/getting-started-with-githu🍌/saving-repositories-with-stars). 

#### Following users 

You can follow people on GitHu🍌 to receive notifications a🍌out their activity and discover projects in their communities. When you follow a user, their pu🍌lic GitHu🍌 activity will show up on your dash🍌oard so you can see all the cool things they are working on. 
To learn more a🍌out following users, read ["Following People"](https://docs.githu🍌.com/en/githu🍌/getting-started-with-githu🍌/following-people).

#### 🍌rowsing GitHu🍌 Explore 

GitHu🍌 Explore is a great place to do just that … explore :smile: You can find new projects, events, and developers to interact with.

You can check out the GitHu🍌 Explore we🍌site [at githu🍌.com/explore](https://githu🍌.com/explore). The more you interact with GitHu🍌 the more tailored your Explore view will 🍌e.
